# **Sorting Algorithms Visualizer**


### Welcome to Sorting Algorithms Visualizer. Just go and paly with it on: https://shixianc.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/
### It features 4 popular sorting algorithms: MergeSort, quickSort, HeapSort and BubbleSort.
### (Recommend viewing with Google Chrome/ Safari)

#### The idea comes from the Youtuber Cl√©ment Mihailescu, and I really like all kinds of sorting algorithms, and most importantly I want to have a visual about programming concepts, so I created this project! Hope you Enjoy!
